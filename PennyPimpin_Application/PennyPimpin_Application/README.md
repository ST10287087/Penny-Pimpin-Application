- if the user navigates to the add category tab on the right they can add an expense category (and allocate a colour to it) and add individual expenses to
  each category (these expenses will be added together to calculate how much the user has spent in each category as well as their total
  spending for the month). In the same tab, the user can also search for all expenses in a specific category over a set period of time that is entered by the user

- if the user navigates to the "Budget Goals" tab on the left, they can add a budget limit for each category that they have created
  these budgets are all added to create the users monthly budget goal.
