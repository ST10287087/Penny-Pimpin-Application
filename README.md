- Add, edit, and delete expense categories
- Set monthly budget goals with minimum and maximum goals
- Assign limits to each individual category
- View how much has been spent on each category
- Search for expenses in each category over a set period of time
- Review graph analytics to determine monthly expenditure
- RoomDB integration for local persistant storage
- Firebase used to store database data online (was unable to be integrated due to time constraints)

## Own Features
- Multi-language support that persists throughout the entire application
- Loan management tool that determines the monthly repayment necessary for the user to repay the loan on time

# How to run the project locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle files and build the project.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical Android device.

# How to use the Application
- After opening the app, the user must choose whether to login (only if they already have an account registered) or Register.
  users will register with their name, email address and password
- Once the user is logged in they are met with a screen showing a live view of how much they have spent in each expense
  category as well as their monthly budget goal.
- if the user navigates to the add category tab on the right they can add an expense category (and allocate a colour to it) and add individual expenses to
  each category (these expenses will be added together to calculate how much the user has spent in each category as well as their total
  spending for the month). In the same tab, the user can also search for all expenses in a specific category over a set period of time that is entered by the user
- if the user navigates to the "Budget Goals" tab on the left, they can add a budget limit for each category that they have created
  these budgets are all added to create the users monthly budget goal.
- User can then view a real-time progress bar that updates according to logged expenditure vs budget limits.
- Thereafter user can further analyse their spending by navigating to the analytics view.
  All user expenditure is graphed neatly in bar graphs with minimum and maximum goals and the ability to filter by a user selectable period.
